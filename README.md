This is an Electron Desktop app written in Javascript. It should run on Windows 10 and up, the most recent 
MacOS and modern Linux distros capable of running other embedded Node and Chromium applications like Electon.

This project is a work in progress. Currently the goal is to host images sent from the mobile app via a P2P connection, visible at https://github.com/Strawberry64/Pareidolia-Mobile.
These images or video will be used for the purpose of training hosted AI models on this desktop
